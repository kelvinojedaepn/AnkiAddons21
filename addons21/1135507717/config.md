general note: check the new and much improved add-on handling in Anki 2.1.50. You might not need this add-on anymore.

### Config

see the description on [ankiweb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1135507717).

The default dialog this add-on creates does not allow you to scroll to the tags. If you have so many tags on a note that the dialog would be bigger than your screen heigt you need another dialog that allows scrolling. When you want to see this alternative dialog depends on your screen height and general zoom level. Adjust the setting `"dialog type: scrollable if more tags than"` as needed. This scrollable dialog has fewer features, e.g. the space and return key are not handled.

**If you have problems with this add-on: <br/>1. Read [this Anki FAQ](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/when-problems-occur.html)<br/>2. Disable all other add-ons, then restart Anki and then try again. If this solves your problem you have an add-on conflict and must decide which add-on is more important for you. <br/>3. If you still have problems, reset the config of this add-on and restart Anki and try again. <br/>4. If it still doesn't work you can report the problem at https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/extended-tag-add-edit-dialog-official-thread/553.**

## Credits

This add-on was made by ijgnd. I use some code made by other people:

The filter dialog is made of source code in the files fuzzy_panel.py. Most of
the code inside the file was originally made by Rene Schallner for his 
https://github.com/renerocksai/sublimeless_zk. I made some changes to these files. For details
